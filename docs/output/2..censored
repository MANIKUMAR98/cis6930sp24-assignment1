saw a lot of the bulls sell ██████ against length in front to mitigate 
margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these ████ are taking off the 
front, they are also buying back ██████.  ███████ large █████ of ███████████ 
█████ taking off spreads.  certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong 
on the way up and such a piece now.   really the only one left with any risk 
premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, 
down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish 
to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments 
for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was 
trading for 55 on ██████.  █████ it was █████.  the market's view of 
probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that 
has to be reflected in h/j.
